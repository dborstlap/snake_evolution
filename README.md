## Introduction

The Snake Game with Genetic Algorithm is a project that combines the classic Snake game with an artificial intelligence (AI) agent that controls the snake using a neural network. The genetic algorithm is utilized to optimize the AI's performance over multiple generations. This project provides an interactive and challenging environment to observe the evolution of the AI-controlled snake's behavior.
